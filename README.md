Geometric Algebra for D

The user is assumed to be familiar with Geometric Algebra (GA) and how it can be used in various areas of computer science (3D engines and DSP in particular).

This project aims to achieve the goal of being able to perform GA computations efficiently by leveraging D's powerful metaprogramming features.

I am by no means the first person to seriously ponder the question of implementing an efficient GA library, yet I think that D compares more than favorably with C++ in this regard (if for no reasons other than ease-of-implementation and maintenance).

## Details
A GA is parameterized by an <i>n</i>-dimensional vector space over the real numbers; its dimension = 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>. In this discussion, we are interested mainly in GAs generated by vector spaces of low dimensionality (commonly < 6).

A multivector (MV) is an element of a particular GA, which can be represented using square matrices of dimension 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>, linked lists (or tuples) of 'basis blades', arrays (static or dynamic) or even SIMD types.

As a compromise between simplicity and efficiency, we choose to represent a MV as a struct having a static array of floating-point numbers; scalar operations are part of any generated code.
(Representing MVs as SIMD types and generating SIMD code is and end-goal, perhaps for another project).

To economize further, a MV can be sparesly parameterized by a list of basis elements whose values can only ever be non-zero.
For example, akin to the way that a 3D vector only ever needs to explicitly store 3 reals, a rotor of G3 (a scalar + bivector) only needs to store 4 reals out of a possible 8.
This parameterization can be done automatically at compile-time:
``` d
struct Multivector(uint[] bitmaps)
{
  real[bitmaps.length] data;
  // ...
}
```

### Euclidean 3D -- G<sup>3</sup>

##### Computing the 'wedge' (aka 'outer') product of vectors a and b, yielding bivector a^b
``` d
ab[0] = (a[0]*b[1])-(a[1]*b[0]);
ab[1] = (a[0]*b[2])-(a[2]*b[0]);
ab[2] = (a[1]*b[2])-(a[2]*b[1]);
```

#### Regressive product
A straightforward implementation of the regressive product in G3 might look like:
``` d
auto regressiveProduct(A, B)(A a, B b)
{
  return ((a * _i3) ^ (b * _i3)) * i3; // i3 is the unit pseudoscalar of G3 and _i3 = -i3
}
```
but one should be concerned about the creation of temporaries and needless multiplies by -1 and 1.

##### Computing the regressive product of bivectors a and b, yielding vector m
``` d
m[0] = -(((((a[1]*(-1)))*(-(b[0]*(-1))))-((-(a[0]*(-1)))*((b[1]*(-1)))))*(1));
m[1] = ((((-(a[2]*(-1)))*(-(b[0]*(-1))))-((-(a[0]*(-1)))*(-(b[2]*(-1)))))*(1));
m[2] -((((-(a[2]*(-1)))*((b[1]*(-1))))-(((a[1]*(-1)))*(-(b[2]*(-1)))))*(1));
```
This looks gross. However, ldc generates the following code with the -O flag set:
```
movq    rax, xmm2
movd    xmm2, eax
shr     rax, 32
movd    xmm4, eax
movq    rax, xmm0
movd    xmm0, eax
shr     rax, 32
movd    xmm5, eax
movaps  xmm6, xmm1
mulss   xmm6, xmm2
mulss   xmm2, xmm5
mulss   xmm1, xmm4
mulss   xmm4, xmm0
subss   xmm2, xmm4
movaps  xmm4, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI0_0]
xorps   xmm2, xmm4
movss   dword ptr [rsp - 8], xmm2
mulss   xmm0, xmm3
subss   xmm0, xmm6
movss   dword ptr [rsp - 4], xmm0
mulss   xmm3, xmm5
subss   xmm1, xmm3
xorps   xmm1, xmm4
movsd   xmm0, qword ptr [rsp - 8]
ret
```
A similar result is obtained using dmd.

### Quaternions -- G<sup>0,2</sup>
The basis for G<sup>0,2</sup> is { 1, <b>e<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>e<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>e<sub>12</sub></b> } = { 1, <b>i</b>, <b>j</b>, <b>k</b> } .

For quaternion Q, Q[0] refers to the value of the '1' component (that is, the 'scalar part' of Q), Q[1] to the value of component <b>i</b>, etc.

A quaternion with scalar part == 0 is termed 'pure imaginary'.

##### Computing the product of quaternions q and r
``` d
qr[0] = (q[0]*r[0])-(q[1]*r[1])-(q[2]*r[2])-(q[3]*r[3]);
qr[1] = (q[0]*r[1])+(q[1]*r[0])+(q[2]*r[3])-(q[3]*r[2]);
qr[2] = (q[0]*r[2])-(q[1]*r[3])+(q[2]*r[0])+(q[3]*r[1]);
qr[3] = (q[0]*r[3])+(q[1]*r[2])-(q[2]*r[1])+(q[3]*r[0]);
```

##### Product of q and v where v is pure imaginary
``` d
qv[0] = -(q[1]*v[0])-(q[2]*v[1])-(q[3]*v[2]);
qv[1] = (q[0]*v[0])+(q[2]*v[2])-(q[3]*v[1]);
qv[2] = (q[0]*v[1])-(q[1]*v[2])+(q[3]*v[0]);
qv[3] = (q[0]*v[2])+(q[1]*v[1])-(q[2]*v[0]);
```
Here, <b>v</b> has 3 components instead of 4; it's still a member of G<sup>0,2</sup> but has a a different _type_ from Q _(think 'PureQuaternion' vs. 'Quaternion')_.

##### Let q and v be as above, and let p = the Clifford conjugate of q
It is the case that p = [q[0], -q[1], -q[2], -q[3]] .
``` d
qvp[0] = ((-(q[1]*v[0])-(q[2]*v[1])-(q[3]*v[2]))*(q[0]))-(((q[0]*v[0])+(q[2]*v[2])-(q[3]*v[1]))*(-q[1]))-(((q[0]*v[1])-(q[1]*v[2])+(q[3]*v[0]))*(-q[2]))-(((q[0]*v[2])+(q[1]*v[1])-(q[2]*v[0]))*(-q[3]));
qvp[1] = ((-(q[1]*v[0])-(q[2]*v[1])-(q[3]*v[2]))*(-q[1]))+(((q[0]*v[0])+(q[2]*v[2])-(q[3]*v[1]))*(q[0]))+(((q[0]*v[1])-(q[1]*v[2])+(q[3]*v[0]))*(-q[3]))-(((q[0]*v[2])+(q[1]*v[1])-(q[2]*v[0]))*(-q[2]));
qvp[2] = ((-(q[1]*v[0])-(q[2]*v[1])-(q[3]*v[2]))*(-q[1]))+(((q[0]*v[0])+(q[2]*v[2])-(q[3]*v[1]))*(q[0]))+(((q[0]*v[1])-(q[1]*v[2])+(q[3]*v[0]))*(-q[3]))-(((q[0]*v[2])+(q[1]*v[1])-(q[2]*v[0]))*(-q[2]));
qvp[3] = ((-(q[1]*v[0])-(q[2]*v[1])-(q[3]*v[2]))*(-q[3]))+(((q[0]*v[0])+(q[2]*v[2])-(q[3]*v[1]))*(-q[2]))-(((q[0]*v[1])-(q[1]*v[2])+(q[3]*v[0]))*(-q[1]))+(((q[0]*v[2])+(q[1]*v[1])-(q[2]*v[0]))*(q[0]));
```
This sort of computation arises when we want to rotate or reflect 3D vectors using normalized quaternions and their conjugates. In this context, <b>v</b> can be interpreted as a 3D vector.

It is worth noting that qvp[0] can only ever be = 0. Expanding, 
``` d
qvp[0] =
-(q[1] * v[0] * q[0]) - (q[2] * v[1] * q[0]) - (q[3] * v[2] * q[0])) +
(q[0] * v[0] * q[1]) + (q[2] * v[2] * q[1]) - (q[3] * v[1] * q[1]) +
(q[0] * v[1] * q[2]) - (q[1] * v[2] * q[2]) + (q[3] * v[0] * q[2]) +
(q[0] * v[2] * q[3]) + (q[1] * v[1] * q[3]) - (q[2] * v[0] * q[3]));
```
The positive and negative terms cancel, and thus qvp is pure imaginary by default.

##### Todo
Ideally, a code generator would realize this. It would generate code that <b>skips the computation of qvp[0]</b> and ensure that qvp is a PureQuaternion.
