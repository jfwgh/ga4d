Geometric Algebra for D

The user is assumed to be familiar with Geometric Algebra (GA) and how it can be used in various areas of computer science (3D engines and DSP in particular).

This project aims to achieve the goal of being able to perform GA computations efficiently by leveraging D's powerful metaprogramming features.

I am by no means the first person to seriously ponder the question of implementing an efficient GA library in a given language.
For reasons unknown to me, D appears to have been overlooked / ignored in favor of more mainstream languages as far as GA implementations are concerned.

## Details
A GA is parameterized by an <i>n</i>-dimensional vector space over the real numbers; its dimension = 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>.
In this discussion, we are interested mainly in GAs generated by vector spaces of low dimensionality (commonly < 6).

An element of a GA is called a multivector (MV), and can be represented using square matrices of dimension 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>, linked lists (or tuples) of 'basis blades', arrays (static or dynamic) or even SIMD types.

As a compromise between simplicity and efficiency, we represent a MV as a struct having a static array of floating-point numbers as the only data member; scalar operations are part of any generated code.
(Representing MVs as SIMD types and generating SIMD code for doing GA computations may be examined at a later time).

To economize further, a MV can be sparesly parameterized by a list of basis elements whose values can only ever be non-zero.
For example, akin to the way that a 3D vector only ever needs to explicitly store 3 reals, a rotor of _G3_ (a scalar + bivector) only needs to store 4 reals out of a possible 8.
This parameterization can be done automatically at compile-time:
``` d
struct Multivector(uint[] bitmaps)
{
  real[bitmaps.length] data;
  // ...
}
```
where there is a 1:1 correspondence between basis elements and bitmaps as indicated below:

First,
``` d
alias grade = popcnt;
```
The bitmaps for the basis elements of any Geometric Algebra G are given by
``` d
enum B = iota(1 << G.dimension);
```
The bitmaps for a _k_-vector of G:
``` d
enum vectorBmps(k) = B.filter!(a => grade(a) == k).array;
```
The bitmaps for a general element of G's even sub-algebra:
``` d
enum evenBmps = B.filter!(a => (grade(a) & 1) == 0).array;
```
Then it is simple to define various MV types in a manner similar to the following:
``` d
alias G3 = GeometricAlgebra!3;
alias Vec3 = Multivector!(G3.vectorBmps!1); // a 1-vector's bitmaps each have 1 bit set
alias Biv3 = Multivector!(G3.vectorBmps!2); // a 2-vector's bitmaps each have 2 bits set
alias Rot3 = Multivector!(G3.evenBmps); // rotor type
```

To prevent an over-proliferation of MV types (and to enforce consistency), a bitmap array used as a template parameter must
1. be strictly monotonically increasing
2. be non-empty
3. not contain a bitmap that would make it such that the MV could not exist in G.

### Euclidean 3D -- G<sup>3</sup>

##### Computing the 'wedge' (aka 'outer') product of vectors a and b, yielding bivector a^b
``` d
ab[0] = (a[0]*b[1])-(a[1]*b[0]);
ab[1] = (a[0]*b[2])-(a[2]*b[0]);
ab[2] = (a[1]*b[2])-(a[2]*b[1]);
```

#### Regressive product
A straightforward implementation of the regressive product of bivectors in G<sup>3</sup> could look like:
``` d
Vec3 regressiveProduct(Biv3 a, Biv3 b)
{
  return ((a * _i3) ^ (b * _i3)) * i3; // i3 is the unit pseudoscalar of G3 and _i3 = -i3
}
```
but this may create temporaries and involve needless multiplies by -1 and 1.

On the other hand, the current code generator sidesteps those concerns and produces this code:
``` d
m[0] = -(((((a[1]*(-1)))*(-(b[0]*(-1))))-((-(a[0]*(-1)))*((b[1]*(-1)))))*(1));
m[1] = ((((-(a[2]*(-1)))*(-(b[0]*(-1))))-((-(a[0]*(-1)))*(-(b[2]*(-1)))))*(1));
m[2] -((((-(a[2]*(-1)))*((b[1]*(-1))))-(((a[1]*(-1)))*(-(b[2]*(-1)))))*(1));
```
which is admittedly unpleasant to look at. However, ldc converts the above source code to the following asm code with the -O flag set:
```
movq    rax, xmm2
movd    xmm2, eax
shr     rax, 32
movd    xmm4, eax
movq    rax, xmm0
movd    xmm0, eax
shr     rax, 32
movd    xmm5, eax
movaps  xmm6, xmm1
mulss   xmm6, xmm2
mulss   xmm2, xmm5
mulss   xmm1, xmm4
mulss   xmm4, xmm0
subss   xmm2, xmm4
movaps  xmm4, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI0_0]
xorps   xmm2, xmm4
movss   dword ptr [rsp - 8], xmm2
mulss   xmm0, xmm3
subss   xmm0, xmm6
movss   dword ptr [rsp - 4], xmm0
mulss   xmm3, xmm5
subss   xmm1, xmm3
xorps   xmm1, xmm4
movsd   xmm0, qword ptr [rsp - 8]
ret
```
A similar result is obtained using dmd.

### Quaternions -- G<sup>0,2</sup>
The basis for G<sup>0,2</sup> is { 1, <b>e<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>e<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>e<sub>12</sub></b> } = { 1, <b>i</b>, <b>j</b>, <b>k</b> } .

For quaternion Q, Q[0] refers to the value of the '1' component (that is, the 'scalar part' of Q), Q[1] to the value of component <b>i</b>, etc.

A quaternion with scalar part == 0 is termed 'pure imaginary'. As shown below, this can be sometimes interpreted as a 3D vector.

##### Computing the product of quaternions q and r
``` d
qr[0] = (q[0]*r[0])-(q[1]*r[1])-(q[2]*r[2])-(q[3]*r[3]);
qr[1] = (q[0]*r[1])+(q[1]*r[0])+(q[2]*r[3])-(q[3]*r[2]);
qr[2] = (q[0]*r[2])-(q[1]*r[3])+(q[2]*r[0])+(q[3]*r[1]);
qr[3] = (q[0]*r[3])+(q[1]*r[2])-(q[2]*r[1])+(q[3]*r[0]);
```

##### Product of q and v where v is pure imaginary
``` d
qv[0] = -(q[1]*v[0])-(q[2]*v[1])-(q[3]*v[2]);
qv[1] = (q[0]*v[0])+(q[2]*v[2])-(q[3]*v[1]);
qv[2] = (q[0]*v[1])-(q[1]*v[2])+(q[3]*v[0]);
qv[3] = (q[0]*v[2])+(q[1]*v[1])-(q[2]*v[0]);
```
Here, <b>v</b> has 3 components instead of 4; it's still a member of G<sup>0,2</sup> but is described in terms of the sub-basis { <b>i</b>, <b>j</b>, <b>k</b> } .

##### Let q and v be as above, and let p = the Clifford conjugate of q
It is the case that p = [q[0], -q[1], -q[2], -q[3]] .
``` d
qvp[0] = ((-(q[1]*v[0])-(q[2]*v[1])-(q[3]*v[2]))*(q[0]))-(((q[0]*v[0])+(q[2]*v[2])-(q[3]*v[1]))*(-q[1]))-(((q[0]*v[1])-(q[1]*v[2])+(q[3]*v[0]))*(-q[2]))-(((q[0]*v[2])+(q[1]*v[1])-(q[2]*v[0]))*(-q[3]));
qvp[1] = ((-(q[1]*v[0])-(q[2]*v[1])-(q[3]*v[2]))*(-q[1]))+(((q[0]*v[0])+(q[2]*v[2])-(q[3]*v[1]))*(q[0]))+(((q[0]*v[1])-(q[1]*v[2])+(q[3]*v[0]))*(-q[3]))-(((q[0]*v[2])+(q[1]*v[1])-(q[2]*v[0]))*(-q[2]));
qvp[2] = ((-(q[1]*v[0])-(q[2]*v[1])-(q[3]*v[2]))*(-q[1]))+(((q[0]*v[0])+(q[2]*v[2])-(q[3]*v[1]))*(q[0]))+(((q[0]*v[1])-(q[1]*v[2])+(q[3]*v[0]))*(-q[3]))-(((q[0]*v[2])+(q[1]*v[1])-(q[2]*v[0]))*(-q[2]));
qvp[3] = ((-(q[1]*v[0])-(q[2]*v[1])-(q[3]*v[2]))*(-q[3]))+(((q[0]*v[0])+(q[2]*v[2])-(q[3]*v[1]))*(-q[2]))-(((q[0]*v[1])-(q[1]*v[2])+(q[3]*v[0]))*(-q[1]))+(((q[0]*v[2])+(q[1]*v[1])-(q[2]*v[0]))*(q[0]));
```
This sort of computation arises when we want to rotate or reflect 3D vectors using normalized quaternions and their conjugates (in the context of 3D rotors, this is sometimes referred to as a 'sandwiching operation').

It is worth noting that qvp[0] can only ever be = 0. Expanding, 
``` d
qvp[0] =
-(q[1] * v[0] * q[0]) - (q[2] * v[1] * q[0]) - (q[3] * v[2] * q[0])) +
(q[0] * v[0] * q[1]) + (q[2] * v[2] * q[1]) - (q[3] * v[1] * q[1]) +
(q[0] * v[1] * q[2]) - (q[1] * v[2] * q[2]) + (q[3] * v[0] * q[2]) +
(q[0] * v[2] * q[3]) + (q[1] * v[1] * q[3]) - (q[2] * v[0] * q[3]));
```
The positive and negative terms cancel, so qvp is pure imaginary by default.

##### Todo
Ideally, a code generator would recognize these sorts of patterns and generate code that
1. skips the computation of elements such as qvp[0] that are known to be algebraically (read: _statically_) equal to zero regardless of the presence of floating-point operations
2. avoids reserving storage space for such elements in the result.
